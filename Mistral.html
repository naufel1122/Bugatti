						The Bugatti Mistral has a start up speed of 2.4 seconds. This is slightly slower than the
						Bugatti Chiron, which can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds. The Mistral's slower start
						up speed is due to its more aerodynamic design, which creates more drag. However, it's start up
						speed is still impressive for a car in its class.
						The Mistral is a track-focused car, and its slower start up speed is not a major concern. The
						car is designed for handling and agility, and it is more than capable of reaching high speeds on
						a racetrack.
