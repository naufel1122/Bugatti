				The Bugatti Centodieci is a limited-production mid-engine sports car produced by French automotive
				manufacturer Bugatti. The car is a homage to the Bugatti EB110 and a celebration of the Bugatti marque's
				110th birthday. It was revealed on 16 August 2019 at "The Quail â€“ A Motorsports Gathering" in
				California, United States. The Centodieci is 20 kg lighter than the Bugatti Chiron, and has an 8,000 cc
				(8.0 L; 488.2 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, rated at 1,176 kW (1,600 PS; 1,578 hp) at 7,000 rpm.

				The Centodieci's design is inspired by the EB110, with a more angular and aggressive appearance. The car
				features a wider track and a lower stance than the Chiron, and is made entirely from carbon fiber. The
				Centodieci also has a unique front end with a larger grille and more pronounced air intakes. The rear
				end of the car is also more aggressive, with a large rear wing and quad exhaust pipes.</p>

						The Bugatti Centodieci has a top speed of 236 mph (380 km/h). This is limited by the car's
						aerodynamics and tires. The Centodieci produces more downforce than the Chiron, which helps it
						to corner faster, but it also creates more drag. This limits the car's top speed.
						The Centodieci is also not designed for top speed. It is designed for handling and agility. The
						car's suspension has been revised to make it more responsive and the car's aerodynamics have
						been optimized for downforce. This makes the Centodieci more capable on a racetrack than the
						Chiron.

						The Bugatti Centodieci has a start up speed of 2.4 seconds. This is slightly slower than the
						Bugatti Chiron, which can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds. The Centodieci's slower
						start up speed is due to its more aerodynamic design, which creates more drag.
						The Centodieci is a track-focused car, and its slower start up speed is not a major concern. The
						car is designed for handling and agility, and it is more than capable of reaching high speeds on
						a racetrack.
